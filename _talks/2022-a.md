Ontology engineering with OTTR: benefits & challenges derived from practical experience

We report our experience gained in the development of the DiProMag Ontology using OTTR.

The DiProMag ontology models experiments with magnetocaloric alloys in the material science domain. Exposing domain experts to OTTR templates instead of RDF helps to simplify the communication and helps to clarify the responsibilities of the involved parties in the ontology development. In a bottom-up (data driven) ontology engineering approach, OTTR template signatures have turned out to be a good basis for communication as they allow the domain experts to take an active role in the ontology development. Furthermore, we show how we involve the OTTR Semantic MediaWiki extension to store template definitions and instantiations in a Wiki as a tool for project internal collaboration.

As a result, we outline the benefits and challenges we observed, explain the design decision we had to make, and propose a starting point for a new methodology that uses OTTR.
