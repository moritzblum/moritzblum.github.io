We are acquiring knowledge from experts to model a small part of their activities, such as, their experiments in the material science domain. We make use of the signatures of OTTR templates as a means of communicating what we have understood and captured, while shielding them from how the knowledge is actually modeled in RDF.

Furthermore, we are integrating OTTR templates into Semantic Mediawiki, so forms can be generated that allow content to be easily added and edited by domain experts and to make use of all the benefits that OTTR brings, which for us mainly means: modular modeling and to abstract from the actual RDF representation.
