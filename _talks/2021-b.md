OTTR (Reasonable Ontology Templates) is a language for the ontological modeling with patterns rather than with RDF triples. Our extension allows patterns to be defined and instantiated directly in SMW, leading to the following benefits for a semantic wiki: the templates allow for a better abstraction, favor uniform modeling and the separation of design and content. Furthermore, a wiki then offers a user-friendly interface (via automatically generated forms) for the interaction with patterns and their instantiations (i.e., the content). The extension works by translating OTTR syntax into SMW-understandable instructions, allowing the instantiation of nested templates and the generation of RDF triples. OUR extension realizes most of the OTTR features such as optional arguments, default values, and list expanders.
