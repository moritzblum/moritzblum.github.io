Welcome,

my name is Moritz, and Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student at the [Semantic Computing Group (Bielefeld University, Germany)](https://www.uni-bielefeld.de/fakultaeten/technische-fakultaet/arbeitsgruppen/semantic-computing/) with a background in Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence. My research interests lie in the intersection of Natural Language Processing and Knowledge Graphs.

As our data is usually distributed across different representations, the goal of my research is to merge data obtained from (structured) Knowledge Graphs and (unstructured) textual sources. This integration can have advantages for Knowledge Graph tasks by leveraging the wealth of large amount of unstructured textual data available on the web, or for NLP tasks by incorporating explicit and structured knowledge from large general domain Knowledge Graphs. The benefits of these approaches include improved performance, reduced need for training data and time, and enhanced explainability.
