This is the front page of my website that is powered by the [academicpages template](https://github.com/academicpages/academicpages.github.io).

My name is Moritz,

Iâ€™m a Ph.D. student with a background in computer science and artificial intelligence. My research interests lie in the intersection of natural language processing and knowledge graphs.

As our data is usually distributed across different representations, I aim to discover innovative ways of jointly integrating structured and unstructured data for various applications.
